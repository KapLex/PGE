CHANGELOG

- 0.03
Fixed pge.texture.load() so that textures less than 16x8 are swizzled correctly (reported by romero126).
Fixed pge.math.deg() and pge.math.rad(), they were the wrong way around (reported by romero126).
Added pge.gfx.transparent() to set or unset the color to be deemed as transparent.
Fixed pge.texture.load() which crashed when attempting to load images not in the PNG format (reported by TheUnderminer).
Moved non-dialog functions from pge.utils to pge.system (suggested by romero126).
Added pge.system.battery functions.
Added pge.system.cpu() to set the CPU (PLL, BUS) frequency.
Fixed pge.controls.pressed() and pge.controls.released(). The flags were being reset when the key was read by the user, instead of at the next update (reported by DarkWolfNine).
Added all the separate parts as external modules. The user loads only what they need (using pge.require).
Added pge.require() to load pge modules.
Fixed pge.wav to play a wider variety of WAV files (crashing bug reported by DarkWolfNine).
Added initial options via pge.ini file.
Added ability to set whether the browser is used or not via pge.ini. This can give the program a considerable amount of extra memory (approx. 6MB) if the browser is not to be used.
Fixed the restart of the EBOOT on error (reported by TheUnderminer & romero126).
Fixed a potential buffer overflow in internal Lua functions that called pge.system.psid().
Added pge.adhoc module (see documentation for further details).
Added UTF-8 support to pge.font.

- 0.02
Added pge.exit() to explicitely exit at any time.
Fixed pge.texture.draw() to only allow the correct number of parameters to be passed (reported by #Gianni#).
Added pge.texture.swizzle() to swizzle a texture.
Added pge.texture.unswizzle() to unswizzle a texture.
Added an optional parameter to pge.texture.load() and pge.texture.loadmemory() to specify whether to swizzle the texture on load.
Added pge.texture.pixel() to get or set the color value of a pixel within a texture.
Added an error check to pge.file.read(), returns nil if nothing could be read.
Added an error check to pge.file.readnum(), returns nil if the number could not be read.
Added a return value to pge.file.write(), returns the number of bytes written.
Fixed pge.mp3.loadmemory() which incorrectly checked for two parameters to be passed when it only requires one (reported by TheUnderminer).
Added pge.math.deg() to convert radians to degrees.
Added pge.math.rad() to convert degrees to radians.
Moved the socket functions to pge.net.socket.function() to give a layer of separation.
Moved the socketset functions to pge.net.socketset.function() to give a layer of separation.
Added an optional parameter to pge.net.socket.receive(), to specify how many bytes to receive.
Fixed pge.texture.save() to unswizzle the texture before saving, then re-swizzle if needed.
Added pge.wav.volume() to set volume.
Added pge.wav.pitch() to change the pitch.
Added pge.wav.data() to access the raw wav data.
